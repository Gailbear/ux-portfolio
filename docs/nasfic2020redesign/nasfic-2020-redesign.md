# NASFiC 2020 Redesign

This was the final assignment for UX919C Information Architecture.

Our assignment was to rearchitect a site's menu system, using a key user experience to show the before and after. I chose [\[Columbus NASFiC 2020\](http://columbus2020nasfic.org)](http://columbus2020nasfic.org "Columbus NASFiC 2020").
