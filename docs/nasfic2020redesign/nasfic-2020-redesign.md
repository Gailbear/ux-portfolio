# NASFiC 2020 Redesign

This was the final assignment for UX919C Information Architecture.

Our assignment was to rearchitect a site's menu system, using a key user experience to show the before and after. I chose [Columbus NASFiC 2020](http://columbus2020nasfic.org "Columbus NASFiC 2020").

## Re-architected Site Map

## User Experience Scenario

Your friend Naomi mentioned that she was participating in a virtual convention this weekend, and that your favorite singer, Tom Smith, was a guest of honor. She gave you the website, \[http://columbus2020nasfic.org\], and told you he's got a concert on friday evening. You want to figure out what time it is, and attend it!
