<h1>UX968C Final Assignment</h1>
<p>Our assignment was to create a Journey Map for one task in a piece of software. For my piece of software, I chose Planorama, a convention planning software being built by Chicago Worldcon In 2022, the World Science Fiction Convention. I am working on this software as a frontend engineer, and also helping design and validate parts of the user experience.</p>

        <p>Pat works a boring 9 to 5 job, and then comes home and spends the rest of the evening volunteering for conventions. Their friends and family are also involved, so "unrelated" gatherings often turn into impromptu meetings. Pat needs software that will help plan the convention program, keeping <strong>all the relevant information secure and in one place.</strong></p>
        <p> Pat has a few concerns about any software they are going to use for the convention. First and foremost, the <strong>privacy of participants</strong> is very important, especially as there are many famous authors. Also, many times in the past participants have found themselves assigned to program items that make them feel uncomfortable, or that they did not really want to be on, so following a <strong>consent-based model for assigning participants to program items</strong> is key.</p>
        <p>Having a more diverse and inclusive convention is very important to Pat. <strong>Diverse and inclusive language</strong> is important to not alienate people, and <strong>diversity metrics</strong> are important to be able to track progress, or lack thereof. Any software needs to include both of those. All content should have a <strong>robust diversity review process</strong>, to help mitigate the impact of unconscious bias.</p>
