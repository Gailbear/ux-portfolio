<h1> UX919C Final Assignment </h1>

<p>This was the final assignment for UX919C Information Architecture.</p>

<p>Our assignment was to rearchitect a site's menu system, using a key user experience to show the before and after. I chose <a href="http://columbus2020nasfic.org">Columbus 2020 NASFiC</a>.

<h2>Re-architected Site Map</h2>

<h2>User Experience Scenario</h2>

<p>Your friend Naomi mentioned that she was participating in a virtual convention this weekend, and that your favorite singer, Tom Smith, was a guest of honor. She gave you the website, <a href="http://columbus2020nasfic.org">http://columbus2020nasfic.org</a>, and told you he's got a concert on friday evening. You want to figure out what time it is, and attend it!</p>
