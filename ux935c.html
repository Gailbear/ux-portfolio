<h1>UX935C Final Assignment</h1>

<p>Our assignment was to create user interface design storyboards that illustrate 2 scenarios in a crowdsourced lost-and-found app. The app I'm designing is called "Finders Seekers". The two scenarios I have wireframed here are a Finder using a mobile phone, and a Seeker using a web browser on a laptop. I have also included some of the activities I did to support this design: 2 persona brainstorms (Finder and Seeker), a metaphor brainstorm, the original context scenarios that I did wireframe, and an additional context scenario that I did not wireframe.</p>

<h2>Persona Brainstorms</h2>
<p>These are not fully formed personas, but a brainstorm I did to help clarify the main type of users of this app. In order to become actual personas, they'd need to be more specified. I also came up with a few more personas that were part of the initial thoughts about users, but I did not flesh out more. They are: </p>
<ul>
    <li> small business who wants to use this as their "lost and found" (a specialized finder)</li>
    <li>a retailer who wants to adverise based on lost item type (so that people can replace their lost item)</li>
    <li>the local police department (especially when it comes to potentially high-value items)</li> 
    <li>the person looking for free stuff or to turn valuable lost items into cash (this is more of an anti-persona, or someone we would not want to use the app, and might need to design for it being hard for them to use)</li>
</ul>

<section id="metaphors">
<h2>Metaphor Brainstorm</h2>
<p>A metaphor brainstorm is when you list a bunch of metaphors for the kind of activity you want your app to do, and then list what those metaphors have as key aspects of their operation and design. This can help give you some context of the types of mental models people might have when using your app. I've highlighted the two metaphors below that I chose to expand on, and in the expansions, I've highlighted things that seem especially relevant to me for my app.</p>
<h3>Metaphors for "Lost and Found"</h3>
<ul>
    <li><mark>Lost and found at school</mark></li>
    <li>Lost pet signs</li>
    <li>Tile app</li>
    <li><mark>Dating app</mark></li>
    <li>freecycle/craigslist</li>
    <li>Ebay</li>
    <li>Police station</li>
    <li>Those signs on the inside of bathroom stalls (for whatever) both “are you being hurt” and “free ukulele lessons”</li>
</ul>
<h4>Lost and found at school</h4>
<ul>
    <li><mark>easy to find location - for example, in my middle school, Near the locker room entrance across from the cafeteria</mark></li>
    <li>Janitors might find things and put them there while cleaning</li>

<h2>Additional Context Scenarios</h2>
<h3>Finder Scenario - Class Ring (longer term)</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Avery is on the T heading home after work when they spot something shiny on the floor. Thinking it might be a quarter, they pick it up, and realize it’s someone’s class ring.</li>
    <li>Avery has recently downloaded the app. They open it up and report a found item</li>
    <li>The app prompts them through taking a picture, choosing a general category, records the location (* how do we do this on a t or in a cab?) and chooses a type of “secret” information - the engraving on the inside, and enters it.</li>
    <li>The app asks Avery where they are putting the ring in the meantime so they don’t forget, Avery chooses the outside pocket of their backpack, and writes that in the app.</li>
    <li>The next morning, the app tells Avery that they have a possible owner. They look at the submitted secret - it says “Beth H. Smith”, but because of the curly font, Avery had thought that it said “Beth N. Smithe” so it wasn’t an automatic match. Avery looks at the picture Beth submitted of the ring, and it matches, and the text is also close, and selects “accept claim”.</li>
    <li>The app presents a few options for giving back the property - Avery chooses “insured package” and prints out the shipping label that it gives her (a la amazon returns). They pack it securely and ship it off at the nearest ups store to headquarters, and marks it in the app. They get a star!</li>
    <li>A few days later, Avery gets a message from Beth thanking them so much for finding the ring, and feels really happy and good.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Seeker Scenario - Class Ring (longer term)</h3>
<ol>
    <li>When Beth goes to take off her rings when she goes to bed, like she does every night, she realizes that she’s lost her class ring. She panics - that is worth a lot of money, and it’s hard to replace!</li>
    <li>She fires up her laptop and goes to the web app. She goes to report a missing item. She describes it as a class ring, and includes identifying details, including a “secret” she picks, the class graduation year. She also notes the general places that she had been that day - the T, walking to her office on newbury street, in her office, and the restaurant she went to for lunch. She also uploads a picture from her facebook from when she got it a few years ago, and posted a picture.</li>
    <li>After she submits, the app searches for a possible match, and comes up with one, showing her the picture. It’s her ring! It asks her to enter the “secret” information specified by the finder , the engraving. She can’t quite remember what it was, so she selects “not exact” and types “Beth H. Smith”. </li>
    <li>Since it’s not an exact match, she gets a message that the finder will compare the details. She goes to bed, relieved.</li>
    <li>In the morning Beth checks the app to see if the finder has responded. She sees that her package is being mailed, insured, back to headquarters and then on to her. She can track the package the whole way.</li>
    <li>A few days later, she receives her ring in the mail, and marks the item as returned. She sends a heartfelt thank you to her anonymous finder through the app, telling them how much it means to her to have this ring back.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Seeker Scenario - Charlie Card (recent)</h3>
<ol>
    <li>When it’s time to get on the T to go home from an outing, Lorenzo realizes he doesn’t have his charlie card</li>
    <li>He opens up his Finders Seekers app to report a missing item.</li>
    <li>He types in a description of what he lost, including “secret” identifying details like the number from his last purchase of funds online.</li>
    <li>His phone shares the GPS history for the last n hours and it analyzes a possible location map.</li>
    <li>He clicks submit and users in those areas are notified.</li>
    <li>He gets a message a few minutes later from Sean who says he found something that might be Lorenzo’s Charlie Card on a sidewalk. The app confirms that the details match, and Sean agrees to meet Lorenzo outside Park Street station. Lorenzo marks the item as found and in transit?</li>
    <li>Lorenzo gets his card back, and marks the case as solved.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Finder Scenario - Charlie Card (recent)</h3>
<ol>

    <li>Sean has previously downloaded the app and is already a user. One day walking in the common, he gets a notification on his phone that someone has lost a charlie card, potentially in this area.</li>
    <li>He takes a quick look around, spotting what looks like a charlie card on the nearby sidewalk.</li>
    <li>He clicks the notification on his phone, which asks for a picture, and prompts him to enter a piece of potentially identifying information specified by the loser (in this case, the number) without seeing what the loser put as the answer.</li>
    <li>The app confirms that the answers match, and opens up a chat screen to contact the Loser. It has some default messages, so Sean chooses “Hey I think I found your lost -----.”</li>
    <li>The app lets Sean pick locations he’s willing to meet Lorenzo on a map (kind of like uber), and then directs both people there.</li>
    <li>To help find lorenzo, when you get close, both phones play the same (catchy, non-trademarked) tune or flash the same color screen</li>
    <li>Sean gives lorenzo back his charlie card, and confirms the drop off happened on his side. He gets a star for doing this thing. Or points, like waze.</li>
</ol>
